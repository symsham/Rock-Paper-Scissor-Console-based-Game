Detailed Analysis

a. Computer's Strategy

The computer analyzes the player's previous choices to predict the most frequent move.

Based on this prediction, the computer strategically selects a move that counters the predicted choice:

If Player's Frequent Move = Rock, the computer selects Paper.

If Player's Frequent Move = Paper, the computer selects Scissors.

If Player's Frequent Move = Scissors, the computer selects Rock.

This predictive strategy introduces an element of artificial intelligence, making the game more challenging and engaging.

b. Outcome Calculation

The outcome is determined by comparing the player’s choice with the computer’s choice using the following logic:

public static int getResult(int playerChoice, int computerChoice) {
    if (playerChoice == computerChoice) return 2; // Draw
    if ((playerChoice == ROCK && computerChoice == SCISSORS) ||
        (playerChoice == PAPER && computerChoice == ROCK) ||
        (playerChoice == SCISSORS && computerChoice == PAPER)) {
        return 0; // Player wins
    }
    return 1; // Computer wins
}

c. Game Flow
